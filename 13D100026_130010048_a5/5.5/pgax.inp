Glossary:
 
  iexp:        Time advancement method; Explicit = 1,  Implicit = 0 

  istop:         iteration number at which the simulation will stop

  iconr:         0 = Start from initial value, 1 = Start from restart files

  nskip:         Iteration after which residual will be printed

  nplot:         Frequency of restart file writes

  mach:          Input mach no.

  density:       Input or free-stream density

  Tin:           Input temperature

  ncfl:          Iteration no. where the cfl no. is changed

  cfln:          cfl value
